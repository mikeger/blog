For example, you can define a custom operator to represent a mathematical operation such as the dot product of two vectors.</li><li>Conciseness: they can help make your code more concise by replacing long, verbose expressions with a single operator. For example, you can define a custom operator to represent a general sequence of operations, such as filtering and allocating an array.</li><li>Consistency: also they can help you maintain consistency in your code by defining a default way to represent certain operations. This can help make your code easier to understand and maintain, especially if you are working on a large project with multiple contributors.
To define a custom operator in Swift, you use the operator keyword and specify the operator&#x27;s symbol and its rank and associativity.
