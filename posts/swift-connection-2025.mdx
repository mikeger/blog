Swift Connection 2025 gathered the European Swift community in Berlin, and I presented the approaches we use at Delivery Hero to keep our Rider app stable while shipping fast. The talk focuses on automating dependency analysis, surfacing risky changes to engineers, and scaling CI to dozens of Swift packages.

Session highlights:

- Why "test everything" is too expensive for large product organizations, and how change-based testing keeps feedback loops short.
- Building trust with product teams by visualizing coverage drift and build health in everyday tooling.
- Leveraging Swift Package Manager structure to prioritise the most critical scenarios first.
