In October 2025 I joined the Mapbox **BUILD** conference to share how our Delivery Hero Rider app team approaches performance when Mapbox Navigation is at the heart of the experience.

Key ideas from the session:

- Treat third-party SDKs as part of your codebase and measure their impact on cold-start, rendering, and hangs.
- Build shared visibility with product and leadership through metrics such as Delivery Hero's Application Quality Score (AQS).
- Iterate together with Mapbox engineers on experiments that reduce hangs without regressing navigation quality for riders.
