This post is intended for my fellow colleagues from Delivery Hero who are interested in the new and noteworthy from the latest Apple WWDC'22 conference. I would focus on the iOS and the most relevant changes specifically curated for the Delivery Hero context.

## Special thanks

I would like to express my special regards to the people who made my trip to WWDC possible this year. First and foremost this would be my wife, who was great support and stayed back home managing kids and other chores at home. As well as her, I would like to thank Delivery Hero for supporting me with the travel arrangements.

## The event

For two years the WWDC conference was held remotely due to COVID-19 travel limitations. This year, a bit of the last-minute, folks from Apple decided to give an opportunity for some of the engineers to meet in person in Cupertino.

Around one thousand engineers from around the world got to meet with each other and share their knowledge and experience in the Apple Park building for one day.

## Keynote

### The new Home Screen

In iOS 16 it would be possible to place widgets on the [home screen](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/06/apple-unveils-new-ways-to-share-and-communicate-in-ios-16/). This feature is available in Beta iOS and in the iOS Simulator.

Why is this first thing I'm mentioning? This prime real estate is as good as gold: this is the first thing that one would see glancing at their smartphone. For an average app user, it is quite common to forget about the app in a couple of days. This would not be the case any more if one of the first things seen on their device is the app's home screen widget.

It is a great opportunity to think about the possible widgets we can offer to our customers and delivery drivers. 

Should we offer a driver a glance over the new order coming their way? Or a next step of the order delivery? Maybe we can delight our customers by showing real-time delivery udpates and consequentially displaying the new offers from their favorite restaurants?

I think we have a great opportunity now to have a _first-mover advantage_. Additionally, it is quite common to feature apps that are delivering the latest experiences on the iOS platform by the store curators. If done in time, this can offer an additional visibility boost for the app.

As you can see on Apple's own demo imagery they are showcasing the order status widget from some coffee shop.

### Wallet

#### Identity verification

Users can use their ID in Wallet for apps requiring identity and age verification. We can use this feature for our drivers, so they can identify themselves with the app.

#### Accepting payments (tap to pay)

It would be possible to accept payments with an iPhone with iOS 16. It is not entirely clear yet, how apps can integrate with this feature, however, for Delivery Hero it could be useful to allow drivers to accept order payment when handing it over to the customer.

#### Order tracking in the Wallet

Now it is possible to have an order tracking integrated with the Wallet. My initial reaction was that it is something that one would expect to use for the goods delivery, however, this could be a great feature for our customers, so they can see the status of their orders.

### Maps

Apple Maps are adding additional functions, such as more detailed _maps_ and look around feature that allows for orientation in dense urban areas. Additionally, Apple is adding server-side functions, such as geocoding, reverse geocoding, search and time of arrival calculation.

## Platforms State of the Union

### Xcode Cloud

Apple's own cloud CI is now available to everyone. Based on my conversation with Apple engineers from the platform tools team, it might have certain edges over the competition, such as a native Xcode integration. It is free for the moment, so I think it would be worth trying for the mobile teams.

### SwiftUI 

Swift, SwiftUI and Live previews would replace UIKit and Interface Builder.

I don't think there's much to add here. We should deprecate iOS 13 and start moving individual parts to the SwiftUI, as it would be getting more and more support from the platform vendor.

### Swift

- [Meet Swift Async Algorithms](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110355/)
- [Distributed Actors](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110356/)
- [Swift Regex](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110357/)
- [Generics](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110353/), [Embrace Swift Generics](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110352/)
- [Swift Package Manager's Package Plugins](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110359/)

### SwiftUI

- [New Navigation API](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10054/)
- [Grid API](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10056/)
- [Swift Charts](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10137/)
- [Lock Screen Widgets](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10050/)

### App Intents

Since the `SiriKit` integration, there was a way to give iOS a better insight in what the users are doing in your app. It was possible by publishing intents to the iOS, such as "opened search screen" or "created an order". Siri is then able to trigger the same action in your app. The common actions are also displayed on the search screen. 

This great feature has now a second breath with the introduction of [app intents](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10032/).

### Passkeys

In collaboration with other big companies, Apple brought a novel private-public key-based authentication to the [customer](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10092/).

### DriverKit

It is now possible to develop hardware drivers for iPad. This might be potentially interesting for building a POS terminal.

### Weather API

We can use this API in order to fetch the weather conditions for a specific location. Potentially useful for the drivers to know.

### Vision Framework

Interact with text and QR codes in the live video feed + Quick actions. This might be relevant for delivery services / package scanning.

### Other developer news

- Bitcode is deprecated
- Xcode view debugger is now working with mixed SwiftUI / UIKit views
- Simulator supports remote notifications now (on Apple Silicon computers)
- Shorthand syntax for if-let

```swift:Example.swift
let foo: String? = ...
if let foo {
  print(foo)
}
```

## General thoughts on the new iOS

From my past experience, it is also crucial to mention how important it is to test on the new iOS 16 before it is released. Ideally on beta 5 - beta 6 stage around the beginning of August.

## Conclusion

Every year at WWDC Apple is introducing it's vision of the future of mobile platforms. We should carefully listen to it, as the majority of our users are utilizing those platforms to connect to us. Along with the improvements for the developers, it is frequently happening that some of the features are effectively killing other small companies implementing similar features. We should try to use the first-mover advantage and be ready for the platform changes to come in.
