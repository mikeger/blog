Hello there! I'm Mike, and I'm thrilled you've stumbled upon my little corner of the digital world. Personal READMEs are a bit like open books about ourselves — they offer a peek into our working styles, preferences, and quirks. Not quite familiar with the concept? Take a moment to skim through [this insightful LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leaders-need-user-manuals-what-i-learned-writing-mine-abby-falik/) by Abby Falik. If LinkedIn isn’t your cup of tea, no worries—stick around, and all will become clear.

Why are you reading this? Chances are, we're about to collaborate, have recently crossed professional paths, or I've nudged you here out of mutual interest. This README is my way of breaking the ice, offering you a user-friendly guide on what to expect when working with me, and, hopefully, setting the stage for a seamless and enjoyable collaboration.

Purpose of This Document: Think of this as a prelude to our journey together. I aim to demystify the essence of Mike Gerasymenko — not just what I do, but how and why I do it. It’s about giving you a head start in understanding me, fostering an environment where we can work together more effectively, and, above all, ensuring our professional relationship thrives.

## Short Bio

I was born and raised in Odesa, Ukraine on the shores of the gorgeous Black Sea. From a very young age I’ve been fascinated with technology and especially with portable electronics and with science fiction.

I graduated with a Master of Applied Mathematics from Odesa National ‘I.I. Mechnikov’ University. During my studies, I started working a part-time job in Software Engineering building websites. In 2009, I joined one of the startup companies from Ukraine called Readdle as an iOS engineer. One of the first projects I worked on was a mobile application for reading e-books. I’ve been extremely fascinated by Apple technology in the original iPhone and the Mac and I’m still a huge fan of this ecosystem.

Over the years I progressed as a mobile engineer and received an opportunity to move to Germany. I worked in Bielefeld first (so I can certify it [exists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bielefeld_conspiracy)) and quickly moved to Berlin to work at a company called Wire. 

Back at the time, the only way to progress one’s career seemed to be going in the direction of engineering management. I chased this avenue and managed to grow until the role of a CTO, but over time my frustration grew. I understood that the role was not the right one for me (you can read more [here](https://gera.cx/posts/career-after-senior)), and transitioned back to engineering joining Delivery Hero as a Staff iOS engineer.

On the home front, I am a proud husband and father to two wonderful boys. Watching my eldest son navigate the challenges and triumphs of middle school serves as a daily reminder of the importance of growth, learning, and adaptation—not just in technology but in life.

## My Personality: A Mix of ISTP and ESTP

I'm somewhere between an ISTP and an ESTP, which means:

- I'm good at finishing tasks. If there’s something that needs to be done, I’m on it.
- I like trying new things, even if they're a bit risky. Sometimes it works out great, other times not so much.
- I get excited about cool projects, but I might forget about the boring stuff that's still important.

## What I Love Most at Work

- **Launching Success**: There's nothing better than seeing our hard work pay off when we launch a project that really makes a difference. It's like scoring a winning goal!
- **Giving Feedback**: I love it when I can offer advice or tips that help my teammates right when they need it. It’s like being able to pass the ball perfectly in a game.
- **Getting Feedback**: Just like catching a pass, I’m all about receiving tips and insights from others. It helps me improve and keep my game strong.
- **Purposeful Work**: Knowing why my work matters and how it fits into the bigger picture is super important to me. It's like having a map during a treasure hunt.
- **Team Unity**: Working with people who are just as excited and driven about our goals as I am feels amazing. We’re like a team who wears the same jersey with pride.
- **Retrospective Discoveries**: Finding out something crucial during a look-back session is like uncovering hidden treasure. It’s a game-changer.
- **Bug Busters**: When our tests catch a bug before it goes live, it feels like we’ve dodged a bullet. It's our safety net in action.

## What I Value from Others

- Efficiency, using the correct medium: Communicate clearly, don't scedule meeting if it can be an email. Do not discuss in DMs.
- Help to improve: Please share any feedback with me. Literally anything.
- Being honest: No bullshit, be transparent with me.
- Growth mindset: Nobody's perfect but it is important to accept it and don't overlook opportunities to improve.

## How to Work with Me and What to Expect from Me

- I would prefer to avoid politics as much as possible.
- Sometimes I need to focus on the task to get it to completion, so I would not be able to answer your message promptly.
- I am very honest and communicate openly. This has downsides, but you can rely on me to share proper feedback with you.
- I know a thing or two about software engineering. I can support you on your project.
- I create processes and documentation. I like to make sure the company does not rely on a single individual to function.
- If there is anything I understood over time, it’s that a fix without a test is not a fix.

## My Expectations from a Manager

- **Clear Priorities and Strategy Alignment**: I appreciate when communication is crystal-clear about what's most important right now and how these priorities align with the company's overall strategy. It's like having a map that shows where we're heading and why.
- **Explicit Expectations**: Knowing exactly what's expected of me makes navigating my responsibilities much smoother. It's like having a recipe for success that I can follow.
- **Insightful Oversight and Feedback**: It's important that my manager knows what I'm working on and can offer timely, constructive feedback to help me improve and stay on track.
- **Empowerment and Recognition**: I value being empowered to make decisions and receiving positive feedback when things go well. It boosts my motivation and reinforces that I'm on the right path.

## How is it Working with Me?

I like getting my hands dirty and working with code, and profilers, analyzing app traffic, researching app bundle contents, using tools to dig binary files, disassemble, jailbreak and do similar things.

Second, I struggle to tolerate mediocre jobs, and I think that many colleagues probably prefer not to have me as their PR reviewer.

On a lighter note, I’m always on the lookout for a chance to share a laugh or a groan-worthy “dad joke.” Humor is a big part of who I am, and I hope my jokes bring a smile, even if they make you shake your head sometimes.

## My average week

- 40% focused work: planning, coding, writing documentation.
- 10% 1-1s with mentees, mentor, key people.
- 10% on meetings I organize: workshops, chapter or guild meetings, key project sync.
- 10% supporting engineers on the projects where they got blocked.
- 10% research on the state of the art, learning, speaking, attending conferences, writing articles.
- I don’t know where the other 20% goes: it’s a mystery.
