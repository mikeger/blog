### Overview

School Countdown respects your privacy. This app is designed to function entirely on your device without collecting, transmitting, or storing personal information on external servers. We do not operate any backend infrastructure, and no user data leaves your device.

⸻

### Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect, store, or share:
	•	Personal data (such as name, email, or location)
	•	Device identifiers or analytics data
	•	Usage statistics or crash logs beyond those automatically collected by Apple (if enabled by the user)
	•	Any information about your countdowns or calendar events

⸻

### Local Data Storage

All countdown data, selected dates, and preferences are stored locally on your device or synchronized across your own devices through Apple’s iCloud Key-Value Store. This synchronization is managed and secured by Apple, and we do not have access to that data.

⸻

### Optional Permissions

The app may request access to:
	•	Calendar – if you choose to import dates from your calendar. This access happens locally; no calendar data is transmitted or stored externally.
	•	Photo Library – if you choose to use a background image for your countdown. The app only reads the images you explicitly select.
All permissions are optional and can be revoked at any time in your device’s settings.

⸻

### Third-Party Services

School Countdown does not integrate with or send data to any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

⸻

### Children’s Privacy

The app is suitable for all ages and does not collect or transmit any information that could identify users, including children under 13.

⸻

### Changes to This Policy

If this Privacy Policy changes, the updated version will be published on our official website and included in the app metadata. The “Last updated” date will reflect any modifications.
