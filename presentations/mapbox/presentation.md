# Delivery Hero Countries

* Truly global usage of the Rider App

# Rider App

* Source of income for hundred thousands of riders
* Must be extermely reliable, as any quality issue is keeping riders from delivering food and is imapcting the company directly

# What is a performance?

* Different people would see it differently
* In general, you would know that performance is bad when you see it
* How to formally define it?

---

# Enter Application Quality Score (AQS)

* Developed in Delivery Hero in-house
* Delivery Hero has 14 apps which are all reporting AQS
* Competition is strong ðŸŽ‰

# Performance in AQS

* App start to interactive (p90)
* All screens time to interactive (p90)
* Frozen frames
* Slow rendering
* Crash-free users -- not really performance
* App Hangs rate
* App size

---

# How big is the usage of Mapbox in the Rider App?

* It's almost always visible on the screen
* We are using Mapbox Navigation SDK as well

# How big is the impact of Mapbox on the AQS?

* App start to interactive -- SDK initialization
* Frozen frames, Slow rendering, App Hangs rate -- SDK performance
* Crash-free users -- SDK crashes
* App size -- SDK size

# Enter Bermuda Triangle

* Leadership

# What are the expectations from adding an SDK to the app?

* I am yet to see an SDK that improves the performance

# Concepts of Ownership

* Locus of control
* Learned helplessness

# Locus of control

---

# Learned helplessness

---

# Antipatterns

* Throwing issues over the fence

---

# Breaking out of the bermuda triangle

* Work with the SDK developers
  * Learn best practices
  * Share detailed bug reports
* Telemetry for performance
* Be careful with new SDK releases
  * Use Beta releases, analyze the telemetry
